            <h2>About Hippos</h2>
            <p>Hippos, or hippopotamuses, are large, mostly herbivorous mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for their massive size, barrel-shaped bodies, and large mouths. Despite their seemingly sluggish appearance, hippos are deceptively fast and are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa.</p>
